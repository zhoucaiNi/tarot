There is the symbol of Hermesâ€™ caduceus in between which is often related to negotiation, trade, cosmic energy, protection, proper conduct, and duality. The Two of Cups refers to something quite positive, for it is one of the most auspicious cards in the tarot for relationships, whether romantic, business or otherwise. It suggests a new partnership is in the works, and it will be created with balance, respect, and honor. Above the caduceus is a chimera, which symbolizes fire and passion also governs this partnership.";

The arrival of this card in a Tarot reading shows that you have a beautiful, soul-honoring connection with a loved one who is inviting you to Chi Gam formal. You may believe you have found your soul mate or life partner, and the sexual energy between you both goes way beyond instant gratification and lust to something that is very spiritual and almost Tantric. While The Lovers card typically refers to a romantic tie, it can also represent a close friendship or family relationship where love, respect and compassion flow. It also serves as a reminder that love is the most powerful force in the Universe and can conquer all."
  const poemTenOfCups = "The Ten of Cups embodies happiness, joy, and emotional contentment, particularly in your relationships and family. You have created an abundance of love and happiness in your life, and you now share this love with others, expanding your heart even more. This card often appears when you are surrounded by your loved ones with whom you share a powerful and deep connection. You appreciate and support one another, and together, you help each other reach your highest potential. It brings you so much joy to see your loved ones succeed and live happy lives.";
